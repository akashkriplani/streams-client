# Streamer Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
This project aims to mimick (somewhat) what happens in Twitch TV application.

## Requirements

You would need to setup an Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) application on your system to make the application work locally.\
This is just the very basic setup and does not deal with the complexity of the OBS set up.\
Download the software from [https://obsproject.com/] (OBS Website).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

If the normal npm install does not work, try using the --legacy-peer-deps flag instead.\

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm start:server`

Runs the json-server to fetch the mock data from db.json file in the application.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

### `npm start:rtmp-server`

Runs the node media server and listens to the streaming coming in from the rtmp server.\
Open [https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server](Node Media Server) guidelines to set it up.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
